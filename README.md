<h1>Virat Kohli goes sarcastic when questioned about MS Dhoni's future</h1>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ever since the conclusion of the <a href="http://oncric.com/tag/icc-world-cup-2019/"><strong>ICC World Cup 2019</strong></a>, the future of MS Dhoni has been the talk of the town. The former skipper, however, has not come forth to talk about the issue. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nonetheless, the fans expected to see India's fine gloveman back on the ground post the World Cup. But it wasn't the case though, Dhoni took sabbatical from the game right after India lost from New Zealand in the semi-final.</p>

<p>The selectors of <a href="http://oncric.com/tag/india-national-cricket-team/"><strong>India National Cricket Team</strong></a> didn't included Dhoni in the home T20I series against South Africa. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Dhoni himself ask for a break. He went Kashmir for helping out in the Paramilitary forces.</p>

<p>The former Indian skipper is away from all the cricket events and media at the moment. And not even the Kohli but the new <a href="http://oncric.com/tag/bcci/"><strong>BCCI</strong></a> president <a href="http://oncric.com/tag/sourav-ganguly/"><strong>Sourav Ganguly</strong></a> is also clueless about Dhoni's future in cricket. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Ganguly said to ask Dhoni and the team selectors regarding the issue once he joins the office on the 24th. </p>

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>“I will find out from the selectors when I meet them on October 24. We will find out what the selectors are thinking and then I will put forth my opinion,”&nbsp;told Ganguly last week.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>He further added that, “We will have to see what Dhoni wants. I will also speak to him what he wants to do and what he does not want to do.&nbsp;Since I was not in the picture, it maybe a case that it’s not clear with me as of now. Now I am in a position to find out and then will decide on the way forward.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>
